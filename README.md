Hi, I’m Aditya 👋  
Computer Science student building AI-backed systems with a focus on APIs and asynchronous processing.

🚀 Flagship project:
Voice Journal – Asynchronous Speech-to-Text system
A backend-driven AI project that converts voice notes into structured text using asynchronous task processing.

🛠 Tech stack:
- Languages: Python, Java, C
- Backend: FastAPI, MERN
- Async & Infra: Redis, Celery
- AI: Speech-to-Text APIs
- Tools: Git, REST APIs

🔍 Interests:
- Neural networks and deep learning fundamentals
- Agentic AI and autonomous systems
- Scalable AI backend architectures

🌱 Currently expanding this project and exploring neural networks step by step.
